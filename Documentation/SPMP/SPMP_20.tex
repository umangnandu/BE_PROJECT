\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Product overview}
\paragraph{}The purpose of the software is to provide a better way for personnel form various industries like creative, corporate and education to present or impart knowledge in a better, more representative, and a more attractive way. As mentioned, the software is targeted for all kinds of professionals and students who are willing to make any kind of a presentation. The expected date for delivery is by 16th March, 2019

\section{ Software Process Model}
{Prototyping model}

\paragraph{}The chosen process model is Prototyping model. The Prototyping Model is a systems development method (SDM) in which a prototype (an early approximation of a final system or product) is built, tested, and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable prototype is finally achieved from which the complete system or product can now be developed. This type of working is essential in our project because all the functional requirements need to be tested as a priority. Another important reason behind choosing this model is to make sure that at the end of the day the users get what they want. The software will be modified and updated until the end-game is achieved and the user is completely satisfied.
