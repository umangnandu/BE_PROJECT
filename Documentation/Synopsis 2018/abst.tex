\end{center}
3D scenes and graphics are widely used in the creative industry. However, the entire task of imagination and then depicting the same as 3D graphics is done manually today, which consumes a lot of time, not to mention the inability to depict the scene precisely as imagined. We aim to reduce human efforts for the same by generating 3D scenes described by the user with precision, and near real-time generation. 
On the other hand, some industries currently lack the use of appropriate technology to make their tasks easier and more captivating, such as the education industry. We intend to replace the existing methods of teaching and learning by using speech to 3D scene generation to depict exactly what the professor is trying to explain.
